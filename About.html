 <p>My name is Angel Chinwe Amadi. I'm an International student from Nigeria and I'm currently studying Software Engineering at NTU.
  There are a lot of things I wanted to improve on, at the start of university. These all contributed to my CPD hours. In this page I will 
  reflect on them. In the other pages I will categorize the below points in different sections.</p>
  

  <p><b>Developing my knowledge of Computing</b>-During college, I was not really sure about the field I wanted to go in, but soon after I found my feet. 
    This meant I had little knowledge on computing, but I knew I wanted to do it at university. I did a lot of things which I will show later on.
    One thing I gained through doing these activities to improve my computing was that I gained a good foundation in HTML and CSS programming
    code. I also got a good understanding in python. Python is an essential part of my Foundation of Computer and Technology module in my
    first year. So, this helped improve my skills for my schoolwork and more importantly preps me for my potential future career. 
    I had a total of 11hours.
  </p>

  <p><b>Develop communicating skill and teamwork</b>-I wanted to improve my communication skills. Coming to university, I wanted to step out of 
  my comfort zone. By joining a number of societies. I was able to do things that I would not feel comfortable doing, making new friends, 
  leading a conference and so many others you are yet to find out. This will help me alot in the working field and the rest of my 
  time at university. I had a total of 13hours. </p>
  

  <p><b>Remain active</b>-I wanted to remain active throughout. Inactivity can lead to a less productive day. This is not good
  for my procrastination neither is it good for my work ethics. During training, I had to quickly put to test my stamina. Though it was a 
  challenge, it made feel healthy. I had a total of 6hours. </p>
