    <p><u><b>Develop my knowledge of Computing</b></u></p>	 
      
    <p><b>Codecademy</b>- At the start of the year I had no knowledge on any programming language. I was confused about a lot of things until my friend introduced 
      me to Codecademy. In a lesson I was able to learn a lot of extra things outside of what we have currently learnt. In way, it put me ahead for instance in html
      using videos and controls. I also did foundation topics in Java script and C++. In the pictures below I showed my certification  in Code Achievement in
      modules I was able to complete.
    </p>

    <p><b>Computer Science Tutorials </b>-In computing, we have Essential skills module and there is a section called Professional development. Recently, we have been
      asked to produce a report. This report is a research-based report. Hence, a lot of evidence and references were required. In order to master the skill of 
      referencing, the school put in place session which we could go to for help in report writing, so that we can meet the universities standards. Also, a very 
      good contribution that helped in my report was the Interactive Systems Research Group video.
    </p>

    <p><b>Devsoc Soviety</b>-This is for individuals who have a desire to program. It includes various challenges from python to hackers challenges. I was able to 
    produce some interesting python games. A confirmation by committee member for my hours can be found down below.
