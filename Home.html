      I will take you on an adventure on what I did to complete my Continuing Professional deveplment hours(CPD). As 
      part of my Essential skills module, I was required to do various extra-curriculum activities in order to improve 
      on myself. This is an important aspect of the course because it will help me with my school work as well as help 
      me with other other aspects of my life outside school. 
    </p>
        
    <p>
      All of my pages aim to explain the activities which I did. More importantly, you'll find my about page consist of 
      some of of the goals I intially set myself at the start of the year and how and if I achieved them through the 
      activities I will be showcashing in this website. I have tried to include pictures and videos where possible. 
    </p>
        
    
    <p>
      However, for the most part, I will just be explaining my various activities. This is due to the current situation 
      the world is in. It meant most activities were online and not enough footage could be gathered. Nevertheless I did 
      try to put some interesting photos in each page just so I know I have your attention.
    </p>
          
    
    <p>
      I hope you enjoy looking through my activities!!
      Below are links to some of my details, if you need more information in terms of location, e.t.c
