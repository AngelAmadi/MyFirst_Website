    <p><b>Host Wealth and Financial Empowerment Seminar</b>-I led a Wealth and Financial Empowerment Seminar on zoom. This built by confidence a lot because after 
    the first seminar I agreed to lead the second meeting they had. This seminar is by a company called <b>NORLAND</b>. This seminar was introduced to 
    me by mum and I saw a challenge, way outside me comfort zone, I was willing to take up. There's a video below!
    </p>

    <p><b>CERT Mentor online session</b>-I interacted with students in different year groups. Who were able to answer questions give and good advice on how to tackle 
    life at university and just life being a computing student in year 1. Personally, they comforted me in areas I was scared about such as tests and assessments. 
    </p>

    <p><b>#Me peer support </b>-This is another support group. We are a group of 6-8 people and we mainly just talk about how our day/week went. We do this to relieve
    stress and just to have a forum to talk to people. That is very helpful when you are feeling down. We write in our logbook per session and reflect on it 
    in the next session. At the end of the session, we do stretches together and afterwards we talk about how we felt  doing it. This a nice and easy time to 
    just cool off.
    </p>

    <p><b>African-Caribbean Society bowling</b>-I joined the ACS society and one the events I went for was bowling. I really enjoyed this because unlike other events,
    it gave us the opportunity to get to know people. We found the competitors amongst us and the relaxed ones (hint I am the first one ðŸ˜†). I enjoyed this 
    thoroughly as I was able to express myself freely. Black History Quiz was also a quiz I took part in during Black history week.
