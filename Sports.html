 <p><u><b>Remain active</b></u></p>
  
 <p><b>Go for trials/training</b>-During training, we had quickly put to test our stamina as many, including myself have been 
   inactive throughout the holiday. Though it was a challenge, I felt healthy and fit after. We had to go into groups of 3's  
   and I met new members as well as old members of the intramural mixed hockey. It was fun showing off skills I previously 
   acquired from playing hockey even my coach and team members commended me. I noticed however, in the short space of 
   time I acquired a lot more hockey skills playing with more experienced players.
